# Kaggle Nerve Image Segmentation Challenge (Work in Progress)

This was my first attempt at a Kaggle Challenge. Unfortunately I did not
understand that one has to make a first submission to enter a competition
and hence missed out on the opportunity. 

However, here is the work in progress. I have followed the pipeline that
inception model follows for data processing and the script is complete. 
Moreover, I'm using TF Slim for model definition. The model definition currently
follows the ENet model. The model defnition is complete however there are
some duplicate code which can be improved. 

### TODO:
- Write the training script
- Train on a GPU

### Note:
- I can't release the data because of the terms in the Kaggle competition
